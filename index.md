# Petition to Replace the Archbishop Ryan "Raider" Mascot

Dear President Barnett, Principal McFadden, Assistant Principal Dooley, Assistant Principal Panepresso, and other [Archbishop Ryan](https://www.archbishopryan.com/) faculty:

We, the students, alumni, and other community members and allies, call for the removal and replacement of the "Raider" mascot. [This mascot image](https://1.cdn.edl.io/iCCxkCNHxS6EE7j1IwPFLMhZuyRbkHJPTOU5VjnrzyLd2lrY.jpg) depicts and stereotypes Indigenous peoples as brutal and violent. Images, like the logo of an Indigenous person or the masks students wear to impersonate Indigenous people, are damagingly racist.

As an organization receiving taxpayer subsidies, it is unacceptable to see this racism proliferate and represent the face of the high school. We request the immediate replacement of this mascot, especially in light of [Archbishop Ryan's recent government aid to alleviate COVID-19 pandemic challenges](https://www.inquirer.com/business/ppp-loans-philadelphia-new-jersey-pennsylvania-20200706.html).

**If you would like to sign the petition, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJuW1oEBvRbSY-VdFCKm9EoAP3ZEk8Y80WHcc_-jFJK1ZXRA/viewform?usp=sf_link).** This petition is inclusive to those within and outside the Archbishop Ryan community. Also, if you would like to email individual administrators directly asking for the mascot's removal, their emails can be found [here](https://www.archbishopryan.com/apps/staff/).
